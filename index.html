                  Lynn J. Brustein-Kampel graduated from the first class of
                  Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva University. She was subsequently
                  admitted to the New York State Bar in 1980 and has practiced
                  exclusively in the field of matrimonial and family law for
                  most of that time. Additionally, she is a founding member of
                  the Woman's Bar Association of Rockland County and has served
                  on the board of directors. Lynn also served as President of
                  the board of directors of the Rockland County Volunteer
                  Counseling Service. For her entire career she has served
                  Rockland, Orange, and Westchester Counties, as well as the
                  Boroughs and has been active in the practice of all aspects of
                  divorce and family law.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The month after Lynn was admitted to the bar to practice law
                  in the state of New York, the equitable Distribution law of
                  the State of New York was passed. This drastically changed the
                  landscape for divorcing families. One of the many changes was
                  that New York went from a title state— if it was in your name
                  you got to keep it— to an equitable (not equal) distribution
                  law. As a result, for the first time pensions and other
                  retirement accounts earned by one spouse became marital
                  property to be shared in a manner the parties agree upon or a
                  Judge decrees.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Over the last four decades since that time there
                  have been many new laws ushered in. Each time that happens it
                  takes years for courts to determine exactly how the law will
                  impact the parties.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The importance of experience cannot be overstated in
                  supporting those who sadly find themselves in the maze of
                  family law matters. Whether you choose mediation,
                  collaborative divorce, or find yourself enmeshed in the court
                  system you should at all times be aware of decisions being
                  made regarding your life.

                    Lynn was wonderful to work with. She is compassionate and
                    warm and really took the time to understand my needs. She
                    allowed me to be a partner in the process listening to me. I
                    felt like Lynn truly cared about me and doing the right
                    thing for me and my family. Lynn was tough when she needed
                    to be. She made a painful experience bearable helping to
                    ensure the process did not extend longer than it needed to.
                    I would highly recommend her.

                    Lynn is an excellent lawyer! I met her after I was divorced.
                    My ex wanted to pay less child support. She got me more than
                    I imagined and even got my portion of my kids college
                    deceased, my ex is paying most of it. I was terrified going
                    into this, but Lynn and her staff were always available to
                    listen to my fears and calm me down. I am so grateful that I
                    found her. She really cared about me, my children and made
                    sure we got what I needed for them. I highly recommend her!

                    I had the pleasure of working with Daniella Presser on my
                    case, and I cannot sing her praises enough! From the initial
                    consultation to the final resolution, she was incredibly
                    helpful, dedicated, and patient. Her attention to detail and
                    thorough understanding of the law were impressive, but it
                    was her patience and empathy that truly made a difference
                    for me. She took the time to explain every step of the
                    process, answered all my questions, and kept me informed
                    throughout. Her dedication to getting the best possible
                    outcome was evident in every aspect of her work. I highly
                    recommend Daniella to anyone seeking legal assistance. She
                    is truly a exceptional lawyer and a kind human being!
